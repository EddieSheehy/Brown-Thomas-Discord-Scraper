# Brown Thomas Web Scraper using Discord WebHooks

This is a Web Scraping python script I developed in 2020. The Script scraped the amount of items in a category and implemented that in to the link to load all items in to a single result.

It then looped through each item in a category and printed out the price, brand and product name.

Watson is a name I chose for my Webhooks due to my interest in the Harry Potter series ⚡️

## How to run
```bash
python3 Watston - Brown Thomas Scraper.py
```
